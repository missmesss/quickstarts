# Tags to be kept empty for now. Tags will specify where in the app descriptions will be available.

  title: Configure your components
  content: |-
    We analyzed your code and defined deployment settings for each of your app components. Before we create and deploy your app, check the values in this view. You can also rename each component if you like.

    - Verify the **target port** is correct.

    - Choose how many **CPUs**, **memory**, and **instances** you want for the app. Their number depends on the amount of resources available to you.

    - Enter the **route** for your app. A route is the public URL for your public application.

    - Define **environment variables** to customize how your components are deployed. To add some sensitive data like passwords, click the **Add from ConfigMap or Secret** option.

    >**NOTE**: You can always reconfigure your app later from the Application view.
