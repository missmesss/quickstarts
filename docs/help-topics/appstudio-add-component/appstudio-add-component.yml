    An application is a collection of one or more components. To add a component, tell us where to find your code, and let App Studio do the rest.

    Here are some possible sources for your code:

    1. **GitHub repository**

       We'll analyze your code, create as many components as your app has, and deploy them to the Development environment included with App Studio.

       >**NOTE**: Currently, App Studio can build apps written using the following language stacks and frameworks: Python, Java, Go, .NET, Node.js, Quarkus, and Spring.

    2. **Quay container image**

       Link a container image with your pre-built app, and App Studio will deploy it to the Development environment. With an image, you can use any programming language you prefer. Your image must be stored in the [Quay container registry](https://quay.io/).

    3) **Sample code**

       Try one of our samples to explore App Studio. Samples are great ways to test out different languages in App Studio.

    When you add your code and click **Next**, you will be able to edit the deployment settings.
